# Passport extraction (camera scan → normalized credential)

How a photographed passport page becomes a normalized credential. Nothing here is
implemented yet; this is the normative target for stage 15.

The one sentence that governs this whole document: **extraction produces untrusted
candidate fields, never evidence.** A camera scan is pixels. OCR turns pixels into text.
No step in that chain is signed by anyone, so a credential built from it attests that an
image was uploaded and parsed, and nothing more. See `docs/trust-model.md`.

## Why the MRZ and not the printed page

A TD3 passport data page carries the same facts twice: the visual inspection zone (VIZ),
laid out for humans, and the machine-readable zone (MRZ), two 44-character lines of OCR-B
designed to be read by machines under bad conditions.

Extraction targets the MRZ. It is fixed-width, single-font, has a known character set,
and carries check digits. The VIZ is variable-layout, multi-font, often has a watermark
or hologram over it, and has no redundancy at all. Reading the MRZ is a solved problem;
reading the VIZ reliably is not.

The cost is that the MRZ does not contain every field. Most importantly it has **no date
of issue** — that is printed in the VIZ only. This does not matter, because `issuedAt` in
the credential means "when the Aletheia issuer attested this", not "when the government
printed the passport". See the field mapping below.

## Field mapping

TD3 line 2 positions, and where each lands in schema v1:

| MRZ field | Positions | Schema v1 field | Transformation |
|---|---|---|---|
| Passport number | 1-9 | — | validated, then discarded; see below |
| Check digit | 10 | — | validates the number |
| Nationality | 11-13 | `nationality` | alpha-3 → ISO 3166-1 numeric |
| Date of birth | 14-19 | `dateOfBirth` | `YYMMDD` → `YYYYMMDD`, century inferred |
| Check digit | 20 | — | validates the date of birth |
| Sex | 21 | — | not in schema v1 |
| Date of expiry | 22-27 | `expiryDate` | `YYMMDD` → `YYYYMMDD`, century inferred |
| Check digit | 28 | — | validates the expiry |
| Personal number | 29-42 | — | not in schema v1; often blank |
| Composite check | 44 | — | validates the line |

Three fields not from the document at all:

- `subject` — the holder's wallet address
- `credentialId` — 31 random bytes, generated per credential (see `docs/credential-schema.md`)
- `issuedAt` — the date the issuer signs, i.e. today

The MRZ's issuing state (line 1, positions 3-5) is deliberately dropped. It is usually
equal to nationality but not always, and schema v1 has one country field. Adding
`issuingState` would be a schema v2 change; there is no Phase 1 claim that needs it.

## Century inference

`YYMMDD` has no century, and getting this wrong silently breaks age claims by 100 years,
so the rule is fixed here rather than left to the parser.

**Expiry** is always `20YY`. A passport in circulation cannot have expired in the 1900s,
and the maximum validity period puts every real expiry comfortably inside this century.

**Date of birth** takes the interpretation that is not in the future relative to
`currentDate`: `20YY` if that date has already passed, otherwise `19YY`. This is correct
for everyone under 100.

For someone at or over 100 both readings are in the past and genuinely ambiguous.
Extraction must then report *ambiguous* and ask for confirmation. It must not pick the
likelier one — a wrong guess here produces a credential the issuer will happily sign and
that will prove a false age claim.

## Nationality codes

The MRZ carries an ICAO alpha-3 code; the schema carries ISO 3166-1 numeric. India is
`IND` → `356`. The mapping table is data, not logic, and belongs in `packages/credential`
alongside the date codec so that one module owns every encoding.

Some ICAO codes have no ISO numeric equivalent and must return *unsupported* rather than
a nearest match:

- `XXA`, `XXB`, `XXC`, `XXX` — stateless persons, refugees, and unspecified nationality
- `GBD`, `GBN`, `GBO`, `GBP`, `GBS` — British national subcategories
- `UNO`, `UNA`, `UNK` — United Nations travel documents

This is the stage-15 gate applied to a real case: an unsupported input says so and stops.

## Check digits are a misread detector, not evidence

The MRZ check digits use ICAO's weighted `7-3-1` modulus 10. They catch the failure mode
that actually matters for a camera scan: `0` read as `O`, `1` as `I`, `5` as `S`, or a
blurred digit. A failing check digit means *re-scan*, and extraction should say exactly
which field failed.

They establish nothing about authenticity. The algorithm is public and deterministic, so
anyone fabricating an MRZ computes valid check digits as a matter of course. A passing
check digit means the text was read correctly; it does not mean the passport is real.

## Passport number

The number is read and validated — format plus its check digit — and then **discarded**.
It is not stored, not signed, and not a proof input.

This follows from schema v1 having no field for it. Adding one would mean a new signed
message layout (`Poseidon(8)`), recompiled circuits, and newly deployed verifiers, which
is a schema v2 project rather than a passport-extraction detail.

It is also worth being clear about what proving anything over the number would buy, which
is less than it sounds. Proving "my document number has valid check digits" proves
nothing, for the reason above. Proving "my document number is *X*" discloses it. The one
genuinely valuable use — one person, one verification — must not be built on this field
either; `docs/credential-schema.md` explains why, and what the correct mechanism is.

Validating the number is still worth doing, because a number that fails its check digit
is strong evidence the whole MRZ read badly, including the date of birth.

## Expiry semantics

`expiryDate` in the credential is **the passport's expiry date**, read from the MRZ.

Consequences, all intended:

- Claim type 3 means "the holder has a travel document that is valid today", which is
  the claim a verifier actually wants.
- Every other claim inherits it. `CredentialClaimBase` enforces
  `expiryDate >= currentDate`, so an age proof already proves the passport is unexpired.
- An expired passport cannot produce a credential at all.
  `assertNormalizedCredential` rejects `expiryDate < issuedAt`, and `issuedAt` is today,
  so the issuer refuses to sign before any proof is attempted. The error surfaces at
  attestation time with a clear cause rather than as an unsatisfiable circuit.

Accepted risk: an Indian passport is valid for ten years (five for minors), so a
credential signed today stays usable for up to a decade on the strength of a single scan
that happened once. Extraction quality is not re-checked over that period, and neither is
whether the passport was subsequently revoked or reported lost. Phase 2 issuers that can
check revocation should shorten `expiryDate` to their own attestation window; the schema
already permits any date, so this is issuer policy, not a format change.

## Where extraction runs

Client-side only. The image never leaves the device, and no server sees the passport.

This preserves the separation `docs/trust-model.md` already relies on: extraction code
cannot sign, and the issuer cannot read documents. It also means the issuer signs values
the user confirmed rather than values it verified — which is the honest position for
Phase 1 and exactly why the issuer is labelled `mock-dev` on-chain.

The user reviews and corrects every extracted field before anything is signed. Extraction
saves typing; it is not an authority.

## What this cannot do, and the way out

No amount of OCR makes a photograph trustworthy. The passport data page is not signed;
the chip inside it is.

An ICAO 9303 e-passport carries a Document Security Object signed by the issuing
country's document signer certificate, chaining to a CSCA in the ICAO master list. That
is a real government signature over the same data groups the MRZ prints. The key that
unlocks the chip over NFC is derived from three MRZ fields — passport number, date of
birth, date of expiry — which is precisely what this extraction step produces.

So MRZ reading is not throwaway work; it is the prerequisite for the real thing. The two
ways to consume the chip data map onto the paths already in
`docs/phase2-digilocker.md`: an issuer that verifies the Document Security Object
off-chain and re-attests (Path A, circuits and contracts unchanged), or verification of
the government signature inside the circuit (Path B, orders of magnitude more
constraints). Path A is the realistic next step.
