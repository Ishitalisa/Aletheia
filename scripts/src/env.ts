/**
 * Everything the M1 runner needs from the outside world, in one place.
 *
 * Three sources, each loaded the honest way and none of them a literal in the runner:
 *
 *   - **Secrets and endpoints** come from the repository-root `.env`, loaded through the
 *     same `loadRootEnv` the query client and `hardhat.config.ts` use.
 *   - **Deployed addresses** come from the committed deployment manifest
 *     (`packages/contracts/deployments/sepolia.json`), the durable copy of the Ignition
 *     output. The runner then cross-checks them live on-chain (`m1.ts`), so a stale
 *     manifest fails loudly rather than sending a transaction to the wrong contract.
 *   - **Contract ABIs** are read from the compiled Hardhat artifacts, so the runner drives
 *     exactly the interface the deployed bytecode was built from. There is no hand-written
 *     ABI here to drift out of sync with the Solidity.
 *
 * A missing input is reported as a named prerequisite ("build the contracts", "set
 * SEPOLIA_RPC_URL"), never worked around with a stub.
