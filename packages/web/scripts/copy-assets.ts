/**
 * Copy the runtime assets the holder flow serves from its own origin into `public/`.
 *
 * The proving artifacts (the circuit wasm, the final zkey, the verification key) are large
 * and are produced by `pnpm --filter @aletheia/circuits run build`, so they are not
 * committed; this script copies the built ones next to the app. Serving them from the app
 * origin — not a CDN — is what lets the proof be produced on the device.
 *
 * Run automatically by `predev`/`prebuild`; fails loudly if an artifact is missing rather
 * than letting the app 404 at proving time.
