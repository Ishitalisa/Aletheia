 * - It is not Sybil resistance, and `identityNullifier` must not be described as such.
 *   Uniqueness holds only among credentials sharing an `identitySecret`.
 * - Under the Phase 1 mock issuer it establishes no real-world uniqueness at all. This
 *   issuer verifies no identity, runs on the holder's own machine, and its salt is
 *   whatever that machine generated, so a holder can mint unlimited distinct values.
 *
 * The guarantee is exactly as strong as the issuer, which in Phase 1 means: not at all.
