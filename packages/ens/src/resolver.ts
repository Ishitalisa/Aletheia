/**
 * ENS resolution, read-only.
 *
 * Two lookups on top of one viem public client:
 *
 *   - **forward** — `resolveAddress("vitalik.eth")` → the address the name points at, or
 *     `null` if the name has no address record.
 *   - **reverse** — `resolveName("0x…")` → the address's primary ENS name, or `null` if
 *     it has none.
 *
 * Both go through the ENS **Universal Resolver proxy** at the address below, which viem
 * `>= 2.35` targets as the canonical ENSv2 entrypoint. viem's `getEnsName` performs the
 * on-chain forward-match itself: a reverse record is only returned if the name it claims
 * resolves back to the same address, so a spoofed reverse record cannot pass.
 *
 * **This package resolves; it never writes.** No registrar, no subname minting, no ENS
 * state on-chain — an address-only flow is first-class, and nobody needs to own a name to
 * use Aletheia. The resolved name is returned to the caller and never stored: not
 * on-chain, not in the subgraph. The wallet address is the sole stored anchor a proof
 * binds to; the name is resolved live at read/display time (`docs/architecture.md`, ENS
 * section).
 *
 * As in `@aletheia/query`, there is no injectable transport. The client uses viem over
 * the configured mainnet RPC and nothing else; the pure input-normalisation seam is
 * unit-tested, and the resolution itself is proven against real mainnet ENS by
 * `scripts/check.ts`.
