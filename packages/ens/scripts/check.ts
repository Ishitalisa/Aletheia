/**
 * The stage 14 gate, run against real mainnet ENS.
 *
 * TODO.md, day 15 exit criteria: "a real name resolves to a real address; a name that
 * does not exist returns not-found rather than throwing; an address with no reverse
 * record is a normal first-class case." This script is the artifact that closes it. It
 * talks to mainnet through the configured `MAINNET_RPC_URL` and the Universal Resolver
 * proxy; there is nothing stubbed.
 *
 * The name below (`vitalik.eth`) is the query *input*, a test vector recorded in
 * `myTasks.md` — not a stored answer. The implementation neither hardcodes its address
 * nor special-cases the name: every value printed is what the Universal Resolver returned
 * live. Pass a different name as the first argument to resolve another.
